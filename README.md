# MNIST Handwritten Digit 

This project uses Pytorch to make predictions based on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. 

Notebooks in 'notebooks' will focus on reproducting basic networks from other sources.

TODO:  

1. Develop multiple networks for MNIST-NN folder.
2. Utilize tensorbord to track and compare preformance metrics for different networks (including CPU vs CUDA time preformance). 
3. Create short comparison of different networks/hardware.
